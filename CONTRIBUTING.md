# Contributing to Discount Detective

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

The goal of this project is to provide a **simple, honest, and fast** utility for shoppers. We value clean code and user privacy above all else.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
* Open an issue on GitHub.
* Clearly describe the issue (e.g., "The calculator returns NaN when input is empty").
* Include a screenshot if possible.

### Suggesting Enhancements
* Open an issue with the tag `enhancement`.
* Explain *why* this feature is useful for the average shopper.
* **Note:** We are currently avoiding "Auto-Detect" features that require reading page content (DOM access) to keep permissions minimal.

### Pull Requests (PRs)
1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure your code follows the existing style (Vanilla JS, CSS variables).
4.  Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
