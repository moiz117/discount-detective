## 🚨 The Problem: "Marketing Math"
Online stores love to trick you. They scream **"50% OFF"** in big letters but hide a tiny **"Up to ₹50"** cap in the fine print.
* **The Trap:** You think you're saving half the price.
* **The Reality:** You're saving barely 5%.

## ✅ The Solution
**Discount Detective** is a manual utility that sits in your browser's Side Panel. It helps you instantly verify the *real* value of any coupon or deal by accounting for hidden caps and shipping fees.

**It works everywhere:**
* 🛒 **E-commerce:** Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Ajio, Nike.
* 🍔 **Food Delivery:** Zomato, Swiggy, EatClub.
* ✈️ **Travel:** MakeMyTrip, Cleartrip.
