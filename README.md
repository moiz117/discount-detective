**Discount Detective** is a lightweight, privacy-first browser extension that helps you see through marketing math. It calculates the **Effective Discount** by accounting for "Max Discount" caps, shipping fees, and hidden charges that retailers often bury in fine print.

## 🚀 Features
* **The "Real" Calculator:** Instantly see if a "50% Off" coupon with a ₹100 cap is actually worth it.
* **Side Panel Mode:** Opens next to your shopping tab so you can compare deals without switching windows.
* **Privacy First:** No tracking, no servers, no data collection. Everything runs locally on your device.
* **Offline Ready:** Works perfectly without an internet connection.
