# Privacy Policy for Discount Detective

**Last Updated:** February 7, 2026

Discount Detective ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension handles your information.

### 1. No Data Collection
We do **not** collect, transmit, or sell any of your personal data.
* We do not track your browsing history.
* We do not collect your IP address or location.
* We do not use analytics or third-party tracking scripts.

### 2. No Automated Page Reading
**We do not scan, scrape, or read the content of the websites you visit.**
* The extension functions purely as a manual calculator.
* It relies entirely on the data you physically type into the input fields (e.g., Price, Discount %, Max Cap).
* The extension does not access the webpage's code (DOM) or read product details automatically.

### 3. Local Data Usage
The extension runs entirely locally on your device.
* **Storage:** We use your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) solely to save your *calculator preferences* (e.g., the last values you typed in). This data never leaves your computer.
* **Calculations:** All mathematical calculations happen instantly in your browser's memory. No data is sent to any external server.
