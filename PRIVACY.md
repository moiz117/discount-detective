# Privacy Policy for Discount Detective

**Last Updated:** February 7, 2026

Discount Detective ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension handles your information.

## 1. No Data Collection
We operate under a strict "Privacy is Paramount" principle.
* **No Tracking:** We do not track your browsing history or search queries.
* **No Identifiers:** We do not collect your IP address, location, or device identifiers.
* **No Analytics:** We do not use Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or any third-party tracking scripts.

## 2. No Webpage Access (Sandboxed Environment)
**The extension does not access the webpage's DOM or read webpage content automatically.**
* **Manual Input Only:** The extension functions purely as a manual calculator. It relies entirely on the data you physically type into the input fields (e.g., Price, Discount %, Max Cap).
* **Technical Isolation:** All DOM (Document Object Model) access is strictly limited to the **extension's own interface** (the popup or side panel) to manage form inputs and display results. The extension does not have permission to read, modify, or interact with the content of the websites you visit.

## 3. Local Data Usage (Transient Memory Only)
The extension operates entirely in your browser's temporary memory (RAM).
* **No Persistent Storage:** We do not use cookies, local storage, or databases to save your data.
* **Zero Footprint:** Once you close the extension or refresh the tab, all input data is instantly cleared from memory. Nothing is saved to your device.
* **In-Memory Calculations:** All mathematical calculations happen instantly in your browser's active session. No data is sent to any external server.
